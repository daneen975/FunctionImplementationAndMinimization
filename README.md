COE328 Lab 2 Â– Logic Function Implementation & Minimization

Objectives
This lab focuses on implementing and simplifying digital logic functions using only NAND gates and the Karnaugh map (K-map) method. I was tasked with translating logic equations into NAND-only circuits and optimizing them for efficiency and minimal gate usage.

Pre-Lab Tasks
1. Inverter with NAND: Implement two different ways to build an inverter using a 2-input NAND gate
2. 3-input NAND: Design a 3-input NAND gate using only 2-input NANDs
3. OR using NAND: Implement a 2-input OR gate using only NANDs
4. Custom Function (??):
   - Design using OR, AND, and NAND gates
   - Re-implement the same logic using only NAND gates
   - Write its truth table and identify the function
   - Express the function as a sum of products and implement it with 4 NAND gates
  
Lab Activities:
- Constructed a custom logic function assigned using my student number
- Simplified the logic function using Karnaugh Maps
- Simulated and verified results using available digital simulation tools in the lab
- Demonstrated correctness and simplicity of the logic circuit
